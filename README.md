# HR-Attrition-Report

# HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard

A business intelligence project aimed at analyzing employee attrition patterns using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for dynamic reporting and KPI tracking.

## Objective
To identify factors contributing to employee turnover and visualize key attrition metrics across departments, job roles, and employee demographics.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Used to extract and prepare the source data
- **Power BI**: Used for data modeling, dashboard creation, and advanced DAX-based analysis
- **Power Query**: Applied to clean and reshape data prior to modeling

## Approach
- Data was initially collected and formatted in Excel
- Power Query was used to handle missing values, rename fields, and filter relevant records
- Several DAX measures were created to calculate attrition rates, average tenure, satisfaction scores, and job involvement metrics
- An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed for HR managers to monitor trends and identify risk areas

## Key Insights
- Departments with the highest attrition rates
- Correlation between satisfaction level and resignation likelihood
- Attrition distribution by age group, gender, and job level
- Impact of years at company and promotion history on employee retention

## Files Included
- `HR_Attrition_Dashboard.pbix`: Power BI report file
- `Cleaned_Attrition_Data.xlsx`: Initial Excel dataset
- `dashboard.png`: Image of the final dashboard
- `README.md`: Project overview

## Notes
This project showcases the full workflow from raw data extraction to executive-level reporting and insight generation, all performed using Microsoft tools.
